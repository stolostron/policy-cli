## Install as a plugin for `oc`

Installing `policytools` as an `oc` plugin is straightforward--copy the binary to a location in the
`PATH` with an `oc-` prefix (or `kubectl-` to install it as a plugin for both `oc` and `kubectl`).
See the
[`kubectl` documentation on plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/)
for additional details on plugins.

You can run this Make target command to build the binary from source and install it as an `oc`
plugin to `/usr/local/bin/`:

```bash
make build-oc-plugin
```

Once in the `PATH` with an `oc-` prefix, then the command is available as:

```bash
oc policytools
```

## Build from source

**NOTE:** Some `policytools` subcommands are made available as standalone binaries if the full
`policytools` CLI isn't desired. These are specified in the [`cmd/`](./cmd/) directory.

### Using Go

Replace `main` with a `release-*` branch to build a particular version:

```
go install github.com/stolostron/policy-cli/cmd/policytools@main
```

### Using Make targets

To build the `policytools` binary and output it to `build/_output/`:

```bash
make build
```

To build all binaries specified in the `cmd/` directory and output them to `build/_output/`:

```bash
make build-all
```

### Development
